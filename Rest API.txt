Rest - Representational State Transfer

we can us eit totransfer data arount 
alternative for tradional web page 

Whats a restful API ?

Ordinary

Server -> Req                           Client
	   <- Res (Html/js/css)



Server	<-> Stores and fetches data but doesn't use/render HTML     				Client(Mobile App)
	   	<-> Wants to acess third-party features (eg.google geo location Api)		Client(Code)
	   	<-> Stores and fetches data but never renders a second HTML page    		Client(Browser w/SPA)

Stateless Backends - they don't care about induvidual clients

Restful Server(API)<urls>

</users>				</posts> 				</products>
[GET][POST][DELETE]     [GET][POST][PATCH]      [GET]

   Not A must to exchange data with JSON(But not html but possible)
   XML
   URLEncoded
   FormData


   RESTful Constraints

   Client Server Arch. - Separation of concerns Restful API should not care about thr UI
   Stateless - No Client Context (e.g.Session) is stored on the server
   Cacheability - Responses must define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheble
   Layered System - Intermediate servers may be used without the client knowing aboiu it
   Uniform Interface - Resources are identified in Req, transfered data is decoupled from db schema
   					   Self-descriptive messages links to further resources
   Code on Demands(opt) - Executuable code could be transfered
